	<p> FemmeHacks is a beginner-friendly, collegiate hackathon for women-identifying* individuals in Philly/NY/NJ, hosted by the University of Pennsylvania's Women in Computer Science. Our goal is to inspire, teach, and empower women in the Philly tech community. We believe that together we can build inventions, learn, inspire one another, and create a community of women* in the field. We have be both beginner and intermediate workshops on Friday in topics like web dev, hardware, and Github (a code collaboration tool). And on Saturday we have all-day hacking with mentors, engineers, hardware, tech companies, start ups, swag, and good food. To learn more, check out: femmehacks.io </p>
